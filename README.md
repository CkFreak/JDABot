# JDABot

This is my first Discord Bot using DV8FromTheWorld's JDA Discord API.

Feel free to use this bot on your own server or improve it and maybe share some of those improvements. 

I am happy about any constructive feedback.

Any information you might need will appear in the wiki shortly.

The bot is under development and will change all the time. Classes and functions will disapear and new one will appear. 

I will make a release once I am done translating it completely and have all the functions in I want to have.

FYI: The bot currently runs on a RaspberryPi Model B first generation for my Server. This will probably not work for a server with 100+ people but I think i'll just do fine for 30+ people.

# JDABot

This is my first Discord Bot using DV8FromTheWorld's JDA Discord API.

Feel free to use this bot on your own server or improve it and maybe share some of those improvements. 

I am happy about any constructive feedback.

The bot is still under development 

The project needs to be opened as a Gradle project in you IDE.

FYI: The bot currently runs on a RaspberryPi Model B first generation for my Server. This will probably not work for a server with 100+ people but I think i'll just do fine for 30+ people.
